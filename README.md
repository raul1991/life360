## About the prototype

The prototype shows how location and bluetooth can be used to track all the people a COVID-19 infected individual came in contact with. If and when a user's friend is tested COVID-19 positive an alert and safety instructions are sent out to all those who this individual came in contact with. Please note, that the whole social graph of the infected individual will be sent out to the government to ease the tracking process.

The gps location is used for visualising the visited places and interaction on the map, send it out to the healthcare officials and government's api (if exists).

## Idea extension
The extensions of this idea will include how to use Google fit's data and geo fencing to send out proximity alerts when a user is nearby a highly COVID-19 site.
Another helpful extension of this app will be to get an alert if any one in bluetooth range is infected.

Please note, I haven't yet come across an api that provides information about the infected patients' currently so it has been mocked in the demo.
